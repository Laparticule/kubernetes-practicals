# kubernetes-practicals
Kubernetes hands-on lab for beginners

# Requirements
1. Install Kubernetes. This lab was intended for multi-nodes clusters, but I recommend starting with Minikube
2. Install or enable ingress-nginx and metrics-server

# How it works
This lab is divided into two parts.
In the first one, you learn about the main components of K8s and the syntax.
In the second one, you get to build a deployment by yourself and learn about more advanced notions.
